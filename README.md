# @julr/factorio

Framework-agnostic model factory system for clean testing. 

Built-on top of [Knex](https://knexjs.org) + [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/), and **heavily** inspired by [Adonis.js](https://adonisjs.com/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

> Have you ever written tests, in which the first 15-20 lines of each test are dedicated to just setting up the database state by using multiple models? With Factorio, you can extract all this set up to a dedicated file and then write the bare minimum code to set up the database state.

## Features
- Support for multiple databases ( SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL ... )
- Integrations with [test runners](#integrations)
- Define variations of your model using [states](#factory-states)
- Define [relations](#relationships)

## Installation
  
```bash
pnpm install @julr/factorio
```

## Integrations

Integrations for some test runners are available below :

- [Japa](./packages/japa-plugin/)

## Defining database connection

Before running your tests, you must initialize Factorio with your database configuration. 

This must be done **BEFORE** creating models via Factorio. In general, you can use the setup files system provided by the test runners.

```ts
const disconnect = defineFactorioConfig({ 
  // See https://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options
  // for more information
  database: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      host: 'localhost',
      user: 'root',
      password: 'password',
      database: 'factorio',
    } 
  }
})

// Once you are done with your tests, you can disconnect from the database
await disconnect()
```

`defineFactorioConfig` returns a function that can be used to disconnect from the database. 

This is useful when you want to cleanly disconnect from the database after all tests have been run.

## Creating factories

```ts
import type { User } from './my-user-interface.js'

const UserFactory = defineFactory<Partial<User>>(({ faker }) => ({
  tableName: 'user',
  fields: { 
    email: faker.internet.email(), 
    referralCode: faker.random.alphaNumeric(6) 
  },
})).build()
```

Make sure that you return an object with all the required properties, otherwise the database will raise not null exceptions.

## Using factories

```ts
import { UserFactory } from './my-factory.js'

const user = await UserFactory.create()
const users = await UserFactory.createMany(10)
```

## Merging attributes

You can override the default set of attributes using the `.merge` method. For example:

```ts
await UserFactory
  .merge({ email: 'test@example.com' })
  .create()
```

When creating multiple instances, you can define an array of attributes and they will merge based upon their indices. For example:

```ts
await UserFactory
  .merge([
    { email: 'foo@example.com' },
    { email: 'bar@example.com' },
  ])
  .createMany(3)
```

In the above example

- The first user will have the email of `foo@example.com`.
- The second user will have the email of `bar@example.com`.
- And, the third user will use the default email address, since the merge array has a length of 2.

## Factory states

Factory states allow you to define variations of your factories as states. For example: On a Post factory, you can have different states to represent published and draft posts.

```ts
import Factory from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Factory'
import Post from 'App/Models/Post'

export const PostFactory = Factory
  .define(Post, ({ faker }) => {
    return {
      title: faker.lorem.sentence(),
      content: faker.lorem.paragraphs(4),
      status: 'DRAFT',
    }
  })
  .state('published', (attributes) => ({
    status: 'PUBLISHED', // ðŸ‘ˆ
  }))
  .build()
```

By default, all posts will be created with DRAFT status. However, you can explicitly apply the published state to create posts with PUBLISHED status.

```ts
await PostFactory.apply('published').createMany(3)
await PostFactory.createMany(3)
```

## Relationships

Soon to be implemented.
